Each client runs the simulation.

Rollback can be performed on the last 10 game states.

Clients also perform prediction on their movements.

The server timestamps commands with an allowance from the client. 
Clients may specify when a command was made up to a limit based on their ping to the server + some allowance for variance.
Otherwise the command will be timestamped as the minimal tick + allowance for each client.

Clients will assume the timestamp of their own commands will be accepted by the server and will updated their simulation accordingly, only if the server
disagrees will a rollback for it's own commands be triggered

When a client receives a command it will rollback the local simulation and resimulate from the tick of the provided command.
Locally controlled units will have their position updated based on the local interpolation + what is received from the server.
The amount of local interpolation should be minimised so that it never grows beyond a specified number of ticks of the commands received from the server.

3 tick ping

On Tick 6 client 1 receives it's own command, no rollback is required as it already predicted it's own command on tick 2, on tick 7 it receives a foriegn command
and rolls back the simulation to tick 2 and replays the game from there.

On Tick 8 client 2 receives a forieng command, it rolls back and includes the tentative C12 command as part of the rolback, when it receives C12 it checks the
timestamp against the predicted command time, as it doesn't differ it does not need to rollback again.
